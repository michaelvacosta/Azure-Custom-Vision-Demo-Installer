# Azure-Custom-Vision-Demo-Installer
Sample application illustrating how to use the Azure Custom Vision APIs to automate the uploading of images and tags into the Custom Vision service.

This sample application is designed to a) illustrate how to use the training/prediction APIs and b) facilitate the uploading/creation of images and tags for those images into the Custom Vision service.

To use the sample application effectively, you will need a zip file containing folders with images that you want to use in your Custom Vision model. Each folder will become a tag and each image in that folder will become associated with that tag.

If you don't have images of your own, you can use the file named "Car Damage Assessment.zip" to test the Custom Vision service and to see the format that is used by this sample application. If you choose to use a Custom Vision model generated from this zip file, you can test that model with the file named Car2.jpg.
